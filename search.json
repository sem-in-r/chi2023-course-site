    "section": "",
    "text": "SEMinR is an R package designed to make structural equation models (SEM) approachable to practitioners across disciplines. It is an open-source and free tool that practitioners can use immediately with minimal setup. SEMinR’s syntax offers a domain-specific language to define structural equation models using R syntax. The syntax is designed with the needs and knowledge of SEM practitioners foremost in mind. While we focus on partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) in this tutorial, SEMinR also includes covariance-based SEMs and covariance-based confirmatory factor analysis. SEMinR has functions named after the major features of a SEM model. For example, consider a PLS-SEM model that has several composite or reflective constructs that are measured by multiple items (e.g., survey questions), with causal paths from a certain set of constructs to others. The syntax for this model might look like this:\nmeasurements <- constructs(\n  reflective(\"Image\",      multi_items(\"IMAG\", 1:5)),\n  composite(\"Expectation\", multi_items(\"CUEX\", 1:3)),\n  composite(\"Loyalty\",     multi_items(\"CUSL\", 1:3), weights = mode_B),\n  composite(\"Complaints\",  single_item(\"CUSCO\")))\n\nstructure <- relationships(\n  paths(from = c(\"Image\", \"Expectation\"), to = c(\"Complaints\", \"Loyalty\"))\nComparing our description of the model to the syntax, we can see that the functions we use correspond to the nomenclature of SEM models that practitioners use: the measurement model is defined using functions called constructs(), reflective(), composite(), and multi_items(); and the structural model is defined by functions using relationships(), and paths(). This makes SEMinR’s syntax highly readable and interpretable to new and expert SEM practitioners alike."
