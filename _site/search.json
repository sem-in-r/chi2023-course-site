    "text": "SEM in HCI\nThis course is an introduction to PLS-SEM for HCI researchers and practitioners that are interested in a streamlined and robust way to work with human data. PLS-SEM will be taught using the open-source SEMinR R package. We will lay out why PLS-SEM might be interesting for your research and how to construct and test a model in SEMinR. Click here for more details.\n\nWhy PLS-SEM?\nPLS-SEM or partial least squares structural equation modelling is a powerful method to build and test models for your data. This method allows the researcher to simultaneously test the validity of their measurement instrument (e.g., the survey) and the relationship between model variables, e.g., perceptions, attitudes, and behavior. A further advantage is that PLS-SEM is comparatively robust to small samples and non-parametric data, both issues that often occur in HCI research. Click here for more details.\n\n\nInstructors\nThe course will be taught by André Calero Valdez, Lilian Kojan, Nicholas Danks and Soumya Ray. The instructors include key authors, maintainers, and contributors of the SEMinR package. For more details go here."

    "text": "What is the result of a PLS-SEM analysis? You have probably seen research papers using path models such as the followng. These are the outputs of structural equation modeling and can be generated using SEMinR.\n\n\n\nFig. 1: A basic model\n\n\nSEMinR is an R package designed to make structural equation models (SEM) approachable to practitioners across disciplines. It is an open-source and free tool that practitioners can use immediately with minimal setup. SEMinR’s syntax offers a domain-specific language to define structural equation models using R syntax. The syntax is designed with the needs and knowledge of SEM practitioners foremost in mind. While we focus on partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) in this tutorial, SEMinR also includes covariance-based SEMs and covariance-based confirmatory factor analysis. SEMinR has functions named after the major features of a SEM model. For example, consider a PLS-SEM model that has several composite or reflective constructs that are measured by multiple items (e.g., survey questions), with causal paths from a certain set of constructs to others. The syntax for this model might look like this:\nmeasurements <- constructs(\n  reflective(\"Image\",      multi_items(\"IMAG\", 1:5)),\n  composite(\"Expectation\", multi_items(\"CUEX\", 1:3)),\n  composite(\"Loyalty\",     multi_items(\"CUSL\", 1:3), weights = mode_B),\n  composite(\"Complaints\",  single_item(\"CUSCO\")))\n\nstructure <- relationships(\n  paths(from = c(\"Image\", \"Expectation\"), to = c(\"Complaints\", \"Loyalty\"))\nComparing our description of the model to the syntax, we can see that the functions we use correspond to the nomenclature of SEM models that practitioners use: the measurement model is defined using functions called constructs(), reflective(), composite(), and multi_items(); and the structural model is defined by functions using relationships(), and paths(). This makes SEMinR’s syntax highly readable and interpretable to new and expert SEM practitioners alike."

It will teach how to draw conclusions from results and inform on how to generate sensible models. This module is half lecture (35 minutes) and half exercise (20 minutes + 15 minutes presentation). We will finish by providing follow-up material on reproducibility on YouTube."
